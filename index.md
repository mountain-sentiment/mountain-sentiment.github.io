## _High Mountains Low Arousal? Distant Reading Topographies of Sentiment in German Swiss Novels in the early 20th Century_

- SNF-COST-Projekt
- DH Lab Basel

### Summary

The project High Mountains Low Arousal? – in close collaboration with the international COST Action “Distant Reading the European Novel” – proposes a contribution to literary studies in terms of digital resource building, literary theory, and methodological development. By means of a distant reading of German-Swiss novels, it aims at pioneering comparative historiographical and systematic research on the German novel of the early 20th Century, using digital methodologies of advanced sentiment analysis (SA).

This rersearch  aims at contributing a new data-driven and philologically reflected perspective on the historiography of Swiss novels of the early 20th Century, situated within the transnational continuum of the German-speaking countries. It examines critically questions of the specificity of Swiss novels as compared to German and Austrian ones, addressing a putative Swiss marginalization, mediocracy, and predominance of anti-modernist realism surfacing in idyllic landscapes and simple plots.

Through thus, it will shed a new view on ideas of Swissness transported by novels during the period, in between educative mediation (Helvetia mediatrix, Lecoultre) and the enactment of a national myth unfolding in spatial topographies that center around the Alps. Offering the first distant reading of the Swiss novel applying SA, the project is comparative within Swiss literature as well as at a transnational level. The overarching aim is to offer a data-driven exploration of the patterns of specificity of Swiss literature in close collaboration with the CA "Distant Reading the European Novel" – to advance digital resource building, literary theory, and methodological development.
