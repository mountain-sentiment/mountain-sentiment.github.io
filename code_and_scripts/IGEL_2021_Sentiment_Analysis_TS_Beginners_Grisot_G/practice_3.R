# ok! you tried with the data provided, but of course every corpus is different!

# can you do the same with yours?


# 1. create a folder in the main project directory add your txt files there. Call it "my_corpus".
# if you do not have a corpus yet, that's ok, too. 
# Just go to project gutenberg and download 6 or 7 novels of your interest in a txt file format.

# remember: if you want to use the same script, your texts must be saved with the filename
# "surname_title_year.txt"

# 2. use the scripts from Sentiment_Analysis_2 to repeat the analysis with your data.
# Paste the scripts here, and change the name of the directories paths 
# (whenever the practice 1 script featured "corpus", it is going to become "my_corpus. 
# Also, subsitute "novels_corpus" and "novels_SA" with names of your choice.

# 3. remember that we split the novels arbitrarily into 15 chapters.
# If you need more or less "fake chapters", change the number in the appropriate section.

# 4. don't forget to comment! you want to be able to recall what you did at all times, so introduce your code with some comment, and add comment for the results, if you want,
